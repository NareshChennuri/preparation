/*

Terraform: (Infrastructure as a Code)
- Mainly infrastructure provisioning tool
- Can deploy 
- relatively new
- more advanced in orchestration

Devops uses 'Ansible' and 'Terraform' both in infrastructure 

Terraform
    - Better for infrastructure

Ansible
    - better for configuring that infrastructure
