skills & qualities 
you will do if they hire you

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be interviewed for this Angular Lead position today.

I am a confident leader who can get the most out of any team.
I pride myself on being able to deliver consistent results for my project.
I am able to delegate tasks based on my team's strenghts, 
and I also ensure I fully brief my team on the objectives we are all responsible for.
and I am always focused on achieving optimum resulsts with a right attitude.

I am ultimately responsible for everything that happens in my team and therefore I will dictate what tasks need to be done and by when.
I believe I have a responsibility as a team leader to help my team learn, improve and be the best versions of themeservles possible.

--------------

I do three things

First I will obtain a clear brief from you, the senior management team, to understand how I can help the company meet its goals and targets. 

Secondly, I will get to know my team inside out that way I will get to know how they are contributing to the team, and what their strenghts are. 
also This will enable me to delegate tasks accordingly, and quickly achieve the company's commercial objectives. 

Finally I will breif the team fully on my expectations in respect of the performance I expect from everyone, and also reiterate the values I expect everyone to follow. It will then be down to me to lead and motivate the team along the way.

I monitor the performance of my team by first of all setting them specific goals and targets I want them to achieve within set timeframes. That way, I have something to measure their performance against.

Leadership is inspiring, motivating and directing a team of people towards achieving a set goal/project or target.
