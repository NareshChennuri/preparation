Roles and Responsibilities:

Lead UI Development: Taking ownership of the frontend development process using Angular, leading a team of frontend developers, and collaborating with backend developers, UX designers, and product managers.
Architectural Design: Defining the frontend architecture, component structure, and coding standards to ensure a maintainable and scalable codebase.
Component Development: Creating complex UI components, templates, and services using Angular, ensuring high performance and optimal user experience.
Responsive Design: Designing and implementing responsive layouts using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Flexbox, delivering a seamless experience across various devices.
State Management: Implementing state management using NgRx or RxJS observables, enabling efficient data flow and synchronization between components.
User Experience Enhancement: Collaborating with UX designers to implement intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces, focusing on usability and accessibility.
Performance Optimization: Utilizing lazy loading, code splitting, and efficient data fetching to optimize page load times and overall application performance.
Integration and API Consumption: Integrating frontend components with backend APIs, ensuring data consistency and effective communication.
Testing and Quality Assurance: Writing unit tests and end-to-end tests using testing frameworks like Jasmine and Protractor, maintaining code quality and stability.
Code Reviews and Mentorship: Conducting code reviews to ensure adherence to best practices, providing constructive feedback, and mentoring junior developers.

Achievements and Contributions:
achieved several milestones that significantly improved the product which includes;

Content Security Policy (CSP): Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP) to enhance web application security, effectively mitigating risks associated with cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and bolstering overall protection against various online threats. 
Modular Architecture: Developed modular component architecture by breaking down the application into reusable components. This enhanced code reusability, reduced duplication, and improved development speed.
Performance Boost: By implementing lazy loading and optimizing data fetching, I reduced initial page load times by 40%, resulting in improved user engagement and satisfaction.
Accessibility Compliance: Recognizing the importance of accessibility in a financial platform, I adhered to WCAG guidelines to ensure that the application was accessible to users with disabilities, such as screen readers and keyboard navigation.
Personalized Financial Insights: I integrated data visualization libraries to present customers with personalized financial insights. This included interactive charts and graphs that provided a clear overview of their account balances, spending patterns, and investment portfolios.
Consistent Styling: I developed a shared component library and established a design system to ensure consistent styling across the application, enhancing the brand identity.
Mobile App Integration: I played a key role in integrating the web application with the company's mobile app, ensuring a consistent look and feel across platforms.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Ensured cross-browser compatibility by using CSS media queries and polyfills, resulting in a consistent experience for all users.
Code Quality and Testing: My rigorous approach to code reviews and testing resulted in a 30% reduction in post-release defects, leading to a more stable and reliable product.

Environment: Angular 14, JavaScript, Typescript, Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Redux, Oracle, Webpack, Angular CLI, REST API, GIT/Bitbucket, Jira, Checkmarx, Jenkins, and Splunk.
