User Feedback Mechanisms:

Implement user feedback mechanisms, such as surveys, feedback forms, or usability testing, to gather insights directly from users.

Error Handling:

Design clear and helpful error messages that guide users on how to correct mistakes. Avoid technical jargon and provide solutions.

Design with a mobile-first approach, considering the constraints and opportunities of smaller screens before scaling up to larger devices.
Intuitive Calls to Action (CTAs):
