=============

UX focus
--------
1) Understand the target audience, their needs and pain points.
2) Collaborate closely with stakeholders, product managers, and designers to gather and analyze requirements.
3) Before initiating the development process we need to ensure a clear understanding of business goals and user objectives.
4) Responsive design for seemless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
5) also we need to integrate Accessibility features such as screenreaders, keyboard navigation to make the application usable by individuals with disabilities. Adhere to web accessibility standards (WCAG) 
6) performace optimization - minimize the load times, implement lazy loading, microfroentend architecture
7) regularly conduct usability testing to identify areas for improvements
8) consistent design patterns and UI components throughout the application
9) Stay Updated with Trends:
Keep abreast of the latest UX trends, tools, and best practices to incorporate innovative solutions into the application.
10) Establish feedback loops with end-users, stakeholders, and the development team to continuously refine and enhance the UX over time.
User Research:

Conduct thorough user research to understand the target audience, their needs, and pain points.
Gather feedback through surveys, interviews, and usability testing to gain insights into user behavior.
Requirements Analysis:
