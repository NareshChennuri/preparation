Hi, I’m Naresh Chennuri. I’ve been working in the UI space for about 14 years now, 
and I currently lead Angular development at Bank of America. Most of my work revolves around 
building modern, scalable web apps—making sure they’re fast, accessible, and easy to maintain.

I lead a cross-functional UI team, coordinating with UX designers, backend teams, QA teams, BA's and product folks. 
I also work with offshore teams, making sure everything stays aligned and on track.
Often taking designs straight from Figma and turning them into clean, 
responsive UI using Angular, Angular Material, Bootstrap, and using component libraries. 

Agile is part of my day-to-day activity — whether it's sprint planning, standups, or retros—I’m involved at every step.

Beyond the tech, I enjoy mentoring devs, improving workflows, and making the development experience smoother for everyone. 
I care about building products that not only work well but feel great to use.

I'm a big believer in writing modular, maintainable code that follows best practices—not just to ship features faster, 
but to keep things solid in the long run.


Here’s a crisp, interview-ready way to explain your project. Use the short pitch first, then the deeper cut if they ask for more.

30-second pitch

ETLabs Innovation Portal is an internal learning community that connects developers to collaborative upskilling and hands-on lab access. Engineers can volunteer to facilitate tech talks, vendor workshops, codeathons, and guided trainings; or learn at their own pace. Teams building a proof of concept can partner with ETLabs experts to get the right architecture and accelerate outcomes. The portal includes a leadership dashboard, reporting/analytics, region-based views, a training calendar with registration & waitlists, invitations, and one-click lab access for Python, Java, Oracle SQL, Cloud, and AI/ML.

2-minute deep dive

Problem we solve: Upskilling is scattered; PoCs stall without the right guidance. We centralize learning, expert pairing, and lab environments so teams move from idea → prototype faster.

Key users: Individual developers, volunteer facilitators, team leads, and leadership.

Core modules:

Leadership Dashboard & Analytics: Adoption, registrations, completions, NPS, waitlist conversions, and region-based breakdowns.

Training Calendar: Browse events, register, auto-waitlist, and receive invite/reminder emails; facilitators manage capacity & rosters.

Reporting: Attendance, skill progression, and PoC status reporting for managers.

Expert Partnering (ETLabs): Intake form routes teams to domain experts who co-design PoCs and review architecture.

One-Click Lab Access: Preprovisioned environments for Python / Java / Oracle SQL / Cloud / AI-ML to remove setup friction.

How it works (flow):

A facilitator posts an event → capacity & region set.

Devs register; overflow goes to waitlist with auto-promote rules.

Emails go out for invites, reminders, and updates.

Attendance feeds analytics (region, topic, seniority).

For PoCs, teams submit a request → ETLabs experts review, propose design patterns, and track outcomes in the portal.

Tech & quality (from my UI lead role):

Angular front end with Material, responsive dashboards, and accessible components (WCAG).

State management with RxJS/NgRx where appropriate; server-side pagination & filtering for reporting.

Role-based access (participant, facilitator, leadership).

Email/invite integration and calendar-friendly exports.

Performance: OnPush, lazy routes, route-level code-splitting; table virtualization for large reports.

Security: Enterprise SSO, guarded routes, audit trails.

Your impact (bullet points you can say)

Led the end-to-end Angular UI, component library, and dashboard UX.

Built the training calendar, registration & waitlist flows, and the invite/reminder pipeline.

Delivered region-based analytics with drill-downs and exportable reports.

Implemented one-click lab access UI for Python/Java/SQL/Cloud/AI-ML environments.

Drove performance & accessibility (OnPush, lazy loading, ARIA, keyboard nav).

Partnered with ETLabs SMEs to encode review checklists & PoC intake into the product.

If they ask for outcomes (tailor with your numbers)

Adoption: “X active users / Y events per quarter.”

Efficiency: “Reduced PoC ramp-up time by ~Z% via expert pairing + lab access.”

Learning: “Improved completion/NPS; decreased no-shows via smarter waitlists.”

Likely follow-ups (quick answers)

What was hardest? Scaling tables/filters for large datasets while keeping UX snappy; solved with server-side queries, virtualization, and memoized selectors.

How do you measure success? Registrations, attendance, completions, waitlist-to-seat conversion, PoC cycle time, and stakeholder NPS.

What’s next? Skill paths with badges, automated PoC blueprints, and deeper analytics (topic efficacy per region).
