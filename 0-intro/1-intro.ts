Hi, I’m Naresh Chennuri. I’ve been working in the UI space for about 14 years now, and I currently lead Angular development at Bank of America. Most of my work revolves around building modern, scalable web apps—making sure they’re fast, accessible, and easy to maintain.

I work closely with UX teams, often taking designs straight from Figma and turning them into clean, responsive UI using Angular, SCSS, and component libraries. I'm a big believer in writing modular, maintainable code that follows best practices—not just to ship features faster, but to keep things solid in the long run.

I lead a cross-functional UI team, coordinating with designers, backend teams, QA, and product folks. I also work with offshore teams, making sure everything stays aligned and on track. Agile is part of my day-to-day—whether it's sprint planning, standups, or retros—I’m involved at every step.

Beyond the tech, I enjoy mentoring devs, improving workflows, and making the development experience smoother for everyone. I care about building products that not only work well but feel great to use.
