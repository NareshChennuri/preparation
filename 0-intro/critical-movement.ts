Critical and challenging situations mostly comes when there is a major release and we were nearing the release, there will be always a great pressure to ensure a smooth launch.

And sometimes there will be a critical issue with the application

Certainly, I'd be happy to share an experience where I had to make a critical decision during a production release 

we were working on a large-scale e-commerce application built with Angular. The application had a complex checkout process involving multiple steps, user interactions, and integration with external payment gateways. We were nearing a major release, and the pressure was on to ensure a smooth launch.

As we were conducting final rounds of testing and quality assurance, we discovered a critical issue with the payment gateway integration. Payments were not being processed successfully, leading to a significant loss in potential revenue if the issue wasn't resolved quickly. The issue was complex and required immediate attention, as the release date was approaching rapidly.

Here's how I managed the situation:

Immediate Assessment: I immediately gathered the development team, including backend developers and QA testers, to discuss the issue. We reviewed logs, error messages, and identified the potential root causes of the problem.

Isolate the Issue: We conducted isolated testing to determine whether the issue was related to the frontend Angular code, the backend APIs, or the payment gateway itself. This involved temporarily simulating payment requests and closely monitoring the response data.

Temporary Rollback Plan: Given the time sensitivity of the situation, we prepared a rollback plan that would allow us to revert to the previous version of the application if we couldn't resolve the issue in time for the release.

Collaboration with Payment Gateway Support: We reached out to the support team of the payment gateway to explain the issue and seek assistance. Their insights were valuable in identifying potential misconfigurations and providing guidance on troubleshooting.

Code Review and Debugging: We conducted an extensive code review of the payment integration code, looking for any recent changes that might have introduced the issue. We also added additional logging and error-handling mechanisms to provide more visibility into the payment process.

Parallel Debugging: While our main team was working on debugging and resolving the issue, we also formed a smaller parallel team to work on the rollback plan, ensuring that we had a solid contingency in case the issue persisted.

Testing and Validation: As we made changes to the code, we performed rigorous testing, both locally and on staging environments, to validate that the payment processing was working correctly. We also simulated various scenarios to ensure the robustness of our solution.

Communication with Stakeholders: Throughout the process, we maintained transparent communication with project managers, product owners, and stakeholders. We kept them informed about the issue, our progress, and the contingency plan.

Fortunately, through the collaborative efforts of the team, we were able to identify and resolve the issue within a compressed timeframe. The critical decision to prioritize the issue, collaborate effectively, and prepare for a rollback if needed, played a pivotal role in ensuring the successful release of the application.

This experience taught me the importance of maintaining a calm and focused mindset during critical situations, the value of effective collaboration and communication, and the significance of having contingency plans in place for unexpected challenges that can arise during production releases.
