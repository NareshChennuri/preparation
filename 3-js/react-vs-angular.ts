Architecture:

React:
Uses a component-based architecture where UI is composed of independent, reusable components.
Relies on a unidirectional data flow (one-way binding).

Angular:
Follows a component-based architecture as well, with a focus on a modular structure.
Uses a bidirectional data binding approach.
Language:

React:
Primarily a library for building user interfaces.
Written in JavaScript and optionally JSX.
Angular:
A full-fledged framework for building web applications.
Written in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript.
Learning Curve:

React:
Generally considered to have a shallower learning curve.
Easier for developers familiar with JavaScript.
Angular:
Can have a steeper learning curve, especially for beginners.
TypeScript and a more extensive set of features contribute to this.
Flexibility:

Virtual DOM helps optimize rendering updates.
Angular:
Can be slightly heavier due to its more extensive feature set.
Offers Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation for improved performance.
Integration:

React:
Easy to integrate with other libraries and frameworks.
Can be used for specific parts of a project.
Angular:
Provides a more integrated solution with a comprehensive set of tools.
Better suited for end-to-end development.
Updates and Releases:

React:
Follows a more gradual and incremental update process.
Angular:
Adheres to a strict release schedule and semantic versioning.
