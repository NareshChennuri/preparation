/*

Ivy is a major update in Angular, interms of compilation and execution.

Ivy improves 
- faster compilation, 
- smaller bundle size, 
- improved performance
- template type checking
- Major advantage is it only recompiles the parts of the application that have changed


- Faster Compilation: Ivy's compilation process is more efficient and faster compared to the previous Angular View Engine.

Smaller Bundle Sizes: Ivy enables better tree-shaking, which means that only the code needed for your application is included in the final bundle, reducing its size.

Enhanced Debugging: Ivy provides improved debugging capabilities, making it easier to identify and troubleshoot issues in your Angular applications.

Improved Performance: Ivy optimizes the rendering process, leading to faster initial rendering and updates.

Incremental Compilation: Ivy's architecture allows for incremental compilation, meaning that only the parts of the application that have changed need to be recompiled, further improving development speed.

Template Type Checking: Ivy includes enhanced template type checking, which helps catch type-related errors in your templates at compile time.
