Components and Directives:

Angular applications are built using components, which are self-contained, reusable building blocks for the UI.

Directives extend HTML with custom behavior. For example, ngIf, ngFor, and ngModel are commonly used directives.

Angular templates use declarative syntax to define how the UI should be displayed based on the component's data.

Data binding allows you to bind component properties to DOM elements, enabling automatic updates.

Dependency Injection:

Angular provides a powerful dependency injection system that helps manage the creation and sharing of application components.

Services:

Services are used to encapsulate reusable business logic and data operations that can be shared across components.
Modules:

Angular apps are organized into modules, which help separate concerns and manage application complexity.
Routing:

Angular's Router module provides robust routing capabilities, allowing developers to build single-page applications with multiple views.
Forms:

Angular supports both template-driven forms and reactive forms, allowing developers to handle user input and validation effectively.
HTTP Client:

The HttpClient module simplifies making HTTP requests and handling responses, aiding in communication with backend services.
Pipes:

Pipes allow data transformations within the template, such as formatting dates, filtering lists, and more.
Interceptors:

Interceptors can be used to intercept HTTP requests and responses to perform tasks like adding headers or handling errors globally.
Animations:

Angular supports animations for creating visually appealing UI transitions and effects.
Internationalization (i18n):

Angular provides tools for building applications that support multiple languages and locales.
Testing:

Angular includes tools like TestBed and Jasmine for writing and running unit tests and integration tests.
Accessibility:

Angular emphasizes accessibility by providing guidelines and tools to ensure applications are usable by people with disabilities.
CLI (Command Line Interface):

The Angular CLI offers commands for scaffolding, building, testing, and deploying Angular applications.
