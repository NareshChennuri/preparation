Question 1: How do you create a custom Angular directive?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation and use case:

Directives in Angular are used to manipulate the DOM and extend the HTML capabilities. They can be particularly useful when you need to apply reusable behavior to different elements or when you want to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. There are three types of directives in Angular: components, attribute directives, and structural directives. To create a custom Angular directive, you need to define a directive class and then apply the @Directive decorator to that class.

Use case: Let's say you want to create a custom directive that changes the background color of an element when the user hovers over it.

Code sample and implementation:

First, create a new TypeScript file for your custom directive, e.g., highlight.directive.ts. Inside this file, import the necessary modules and define the directive class:

import { Directive, ElementRef, HostListener, Input } from '@angular/core'; 

@Directive({ selector: '[appHighlight]' }) 

export class HighlightDirective { 

    @Input('appHighlight') highlightColor: string; 

    constructor(private el: ElementRef) {} 

    @HostListener('mouseenter') onMouseEnter() { 
        this.highlight(this.highlightColor || 'yellow'); 
    } 

    @HostListener('mouseleave') onMouseLeave() { 
        this.highlight(null); 
    } 

    private highlight(color: string) { 
        this.el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = color; 
    } 
}

Next, you need to declare the directive in the appropriate module. In this case, let's assume it's the app.module.ts file:
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { AppComponent } from './app.component'; import { HighlightDirective } from './highlight.directive'; @NgModule({ declarations: [ AppComponent, HighlightDirective ], imports: [ BrowserModule ], providers: [], bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule { }

Finally, you can use the custom directive in your component's HTML template:
<p appHighlight="lightblue">Hover over me to change the background color!</p>

In this example, the appHighlight attribute directive is applied to a paragraph element. When the user hovers over the element, its background color will change to light blue. When the user moves the cursor away, the background color will revert to its original state.

Question 2: How can you implement two-way data binding in Angular?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation of two-way data binding:

Two-way data binding is a feature in Angular that enables synchronization between the model (component) and the view (template) in both directions. When the model changes, the view is automatically updated, and vice versa. This makes it easy to keep the view and model in sync, reducing the amount of code required to handle user interactions and data updates. In Angular, two-way data binding is typically achieved using a combination of property binding and event binding, represented by the [(ngModel)] directive.

Code sample demonstrating the concept:

Let's say you have a simple form that captures a user's name. The app.component.ts file contains the following code:

import { Component } from '@angular/core'; @Component({ selector: 'app-root', templateUrl: './app.component.html', styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'] }) export class AppComponent { name = ''; }

To implement two-way data binding, first, add the FormsModule to the app.module.ts file:import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'; // Import FormsModule import { AppComponent } from './app.component'; @NgModule({ declarations: [ AppComponent ], imports: [ BrowserModule, FormsModule // Add FormsModule to the imports array ], providers: [], bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule { }

Now, in the app.component.html file, you can use the [(ngModel)] directive to enable two-way data binding:

<label for="name">Name:</label> <input type="text" id="name" [(ngModel)]="name" /> <p>Hello, {{name}}!</p>

In this example, the [(ngModel)] directive binds the input element's value to the name property in the AppComponent class. When the user types their name into the input field, the name property is automatically updated, and the view displays the updated value in the paragraph element.


 

Question 3: How can you create a service in Angular and inject it into a component?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Services in Angular are classes that encapsulate some specific functionality and can be reused across multiple components. They can be injected into components using Angular's Dependency Injection (DI) system, which simplifies the code and makes it easier to maintain and test.

Explanation of services and dependency injection:

Services: In Angular, a service is a class that contains methods and properties related to a specific functionality. It helps you to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle by extracting common logic into separate classes, making the code more modular and maintainable.

Dependency Injection: DI is a design pattern where a class receives its dependencies from an external source, rather than creating them internally. In Angular, the DI system is responsible for providing instances of services to the components that need them. This improves code maintainability, testability, and makes it easier to manage dependencies.

Code sample for creating a service and using it in a component:

Create a service using the Angular CLI:
ng generate service my-service

This command will generate a my-service.service.ts file.

2. Implement the service:

my-service.service.ts:

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; 
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }) 
export class MyServiceService { 
    constructor() { } 
    getGreeting(): string { 
        return 'Hello from MyService!'; 
    } 
}

In this example, we have a simple service that has a method getGreeting() which returns a greeting string.

3. Use the service in a component:

app.component.ts:

import { Component } from '@angular/core'; 
import { MyServiceService } from './my-service.service'; 
@Component({ 
    selector: 'app-root', 
    templateUrl: './app.component.html', 
    styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss'] 
}) 
export class AppComponent { 
    greeting: string; 
    constructor(private myService: MyServiceService) { 
        this.greeting = this.myService.getGreeting(); 
    } 
}

In the component, we import the service and then inject it into the constructor using the private keyword. This makes the service available as a property of the component, and we can access its methods directly. In this example, we're using the getGreeting() method to set the value of the greeting property.

4. Display the greeting in the component's template:

app.component.html:

<h1>{{ greeting }}</h1>

This will display the greeting returned by the getGreeting() method of the service.

By using services and dependency injection, we can easily share common functionality between different components and keep our code organized and maintainable.

Question 4 : How do you handle form validation in Angular?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Angular provides two main techniques for handling form validation: Reactive Forms and Template-driven Forms. Reactive Forms offer more flexibility and control, while Template-driven Forms are simpler to set up. Both techniques use Angular's built-in form validation.

Explanation of Angular's form validation techniques:

Reactive Forms: In Reactive Forms, you create form controls and validations programmatically in the component class. It provides a better separation of concerns and is more suitable for complex and dynamic forms.
Template-driven Forms: In Template-driven Forms, form controls and validations are declared in the template using directives. It's easier to set up and is suitable for simple forms and scenarios.
Code sample for implementing form validation:

Here, we'll demonstrate form validation using Reactive Forms:

Import ReactiveFormsModule in your AppModule:
app.module.ts:

import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'; 
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; 
import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms'; // Import ReactiveFormsModule 
import { AppComponent } from './app.component'; 
@NgModule({ 
    declarations: [ AppComponent ], 
    imports: [ BrowserModule, ReactiveFormsModule // Add ReactiveFormsModule to imports ], 
    providers: [], 
    bootstrap: [AppComponent] 
}) 
export class AppModule { }

2. Set up the form model and validations in the component class:

app.component.ts:

import { Component } from '@angular/core'; 
import { FormGroup, FormControl, Validators } from '@angular/forms'; 
@Component(
    { selector: 'app-root', templateUrl: './app.component.html', 
    styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss'] 
}) 
export class AppComponent { 
    registrationForm = new FormGroup({ 
        firstName: new FormControl('', Validators.required), 
        lastName: new FormControl('', Validators.required), 
        email: new FormControl('', [Validators.required, Validators.email]) 
    }); 
        
    onSubmit() { console.log(this.registrationForm.value); } 
}

In this example, we create a FormGroup containing FormControl instances for firstName, lastName, and email. Each control has one or more Validators assigned to it.

Set up the form in the component's template:
app.component.html:

<form [formGroup]="registrationForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()"> 
    <div> 
        <label for="firstName">First Name:</label> 
        <input id="firstName" type="text" formControlName="firstName"> 
        <div *ngIf="registrationForm.controls.firstName.invalid && registrationForm.controls.firstName.touched"> First name is required. </div> 
    </div> 
    <div> 
        <label for="lastName">Last Name:</label> 
        <input id="lastName" type="text" formControlName="lastName"> 
        <div *ngIf="registrationForm.controls.lastName.invalid && registrationForm.controls.lastName.touched"> Last name is required. </div> 
    </div> 
    <div> 
        <label for="email">Email:</label> 
        <input id="email" type="email" formControlName="email"> 
        <div *ngIf="registrationForm.controls.email.invalid && registrationForm.controls.email.touched"> Email is required and must be valid. </div> 
    </div> 
    <button type="submit" [disabled]="registrationForm.invalid">Register</button> 
</form>

In the template, we bind the form to the registrationForm FormGroup instance and associate each input with the corresponding FormControl using the formControlName directive. We also display error messages based on the validity and touched state of each control.

By implementing form validation in Angular, you can ensure that user inputs meet the required criteria before submitting the form, improving the overall user experience and data quality.

Question 5: How do you implement lazy loading of modules in Angular?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lazy loading is a design pattern where modules or components are loaded only when they are needed, rather than loading everything at the application startup. This can significantly improve the performance and startup time of your Angular application, as it reduces the initial bundle size.

Benefits of lazy loading:

Faster initial loading: Only the required modules and components are loaded at the start, reducing the initial bundle size and improving the application's loading time.
On-demand loading: Modules are loaded when needed, optimizing resource usage and reducing memory consumption.
Better user experience: Users experience a more responsive application as they only need to wait for the required components to load, rather than the entire application.
To implement lazy loading in Angular, you need to use Angular's routing mechanism. Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing lazy loading in Angular:

Create a new module (for example, a feature module) and its routing configuration:
ng generate module feature --route feature --module app.module

This command will create a FeatureModule, a FeatureComponent, and update the app-routing.module.ts with a new route configuration.

2. Configure the new route to use loadChildren in app-routing.module.ts:

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router'; const routes: Routes = [ { path: 'feature', loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule) }, // other routes... ]; @NgModule({ imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)], exports: [RouterModule] }) export class AppRoutingModule { }

In this example, the 'feature' path is configured with a loadChildren property, which uses the import() function to load the FeatureModule asynchronously. The FeatureModule is loaded only when the user navigates to the 'feature' route.

3. Add routes for the components inside the feature module:

Inside the feature-routing.module.ts, add the routes for the components you want to load lazily.

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router'; import { FeatureComponent } from './feature.component'; const routes: Routes = [ { path: '', component: FeatureComponent }, // other routes... ]; @NgModule({ imports: [RouterModule.forChild(routes)], exports: [RouterModule] }) export class FeatureRoutingModule { }

Now, when a user navigates to the 'feature' route, the FeatureModule will be loaded lazily, improving the overall performance of your Angular application.

Question 6: How do you handle HTTP requests in Angular?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In Angular, HTTP requests are handled using the HttpClient module, which provides a simple and efficient way to make API calls and manage HTTP communication. The HttpClient module uses RxJS Observables to handle asynchronous operations, allowing you to easily chain and manipulate data.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use Angular's HttpClient module to make HTTP requests:

Import HttpClientModule:
First, you need to import the HttpClientModule in your application's main module (typically app.module.ts) and add it to the imports array.

import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http'; import { AppComponent } from './app.component'; @NgModule({ declarations: [ AppComponent ], imports: [ BrowserModule, HttpClientModule ], providers: [], bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule { }

2. Inject HttpClient:

Next, inject the HttpClient into your component or service where you want to make the HTTP request. For example, let's create a DataService:

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'; import { Observable } from 'rxjs'; @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }) export class DataService { constructor(private http: HttpClient) { } }

3. Make HTTP requests:

Use the HttpClient instance to make HTTP requests. The most common methods are get(), post(), put(), and delete(). These methods return an Observable, which you can subscribe to and handle the response.

For example, let's create a method to fetch data from a JSON API:

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'; import { Observable } from 'rxjs'; @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' }) export class DataService { private apiUrl = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'; constructor(private http: HttpClient) { } getData(): Observable<any> { return this.http.get(this.apiUrl); } }

4. Subscribe to the Observable:

Now, you can subscribe to the Observable returned by the getData() method in your component and handle the response.

import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core'; import { DataService } from './data.service'; @Component({ selector: 'app-root', templateUrl: './app.component.html', styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'] }) export class AppComponent implements OnInit { data: any; constructor(private dataService: DataService) { } ngOnInit(): void { this.dataService.getData().subscribe(response => { this.data = response; }); } }

In this example, the AppComponent subscribes to the Observable returned by the getData() method, and the response is assigned to the data property. You can now use this data in your template or perform other operations as needed.

This is a basic example of how to use Angular's HttpClient module to make HTTP requests. Remember that you can also use various operators from RxJS to transform, filter, or combine data streams as required.

Question 7: How do you create and use pipes in Angular?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Pipes in Angular are a way to transform and format data before displaying it in the view. They provide an easy and clean way to modify the output without changing the underlying data or logic. Some built-in pipes in Angular include uppercase, lowercase, date, currency, and percent.

To create and use a custom pipe in Angular, follow these steps:

Create a custom pipe:
Use Angular CLI to generate a new pipe:

ng generate pipe my-custom-pipe

This command will create a new file named my-custom-pipe.pipe.ts. In this file, you'll find a class with a @Pipe decorator.

2. Implement the custom pipe:

Edit the my-custom-pipe.pipe.ts file and implement your custom logic inside the transform() method. The transform() method accepts an input value and any additional arguments, and it returns the transformed value.

For example, let's create a custom pipe that reverses a string:

import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core'; @Pipe({ name: 'myCustomPipe' }) export class MyCustomPipePipe implements PipeTransform { transform(value: string, ...args: unknown[]): string { return value.split('').reverse().join(''); } }

3. Use the custom pipe in a template:

To use your custom pipe, first, import it in your app.module.ts and add it to the declarations array.

import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { MyCustomPipePipe } from './my-custom-pipe.pipe'; import { AppComponent } from './app.component'; @NgModule({ declarations: [ AppComponent, MyCustomPipePipe ], imports: [ BrowserModule ], providers: [], bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule { }

Now, you can use the custom pipe in your template using the pipe operator |. Let's use the custom pipe in app.component.html:

<h1>{{ 'Hello, Angular!' | myCustomPipe }}</h1>

The output will be: "!ralugnA ,olleH".

In this example, we created a custom pipe to reverse a string and used it in a template. You can create more complex pipes and chain multiple pipes together to perform various transformations on your data.

Question 8: How do you implement routing in an Angular application?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Angular routing allows you to navigate between different components in your application based on the URL. It enables you to create Single Page Applications (SPAs), where navigation between views happens without a full page refresh.

To implement routing in an Angular application, follow these steps:

Generate AppRoutingModule:
If you didn't create a routing module when initializing your Angular project, you can create one using the Angular CLI:

ng generate module app-routing --flat --module=app

This command generates the app-routing.module.ts file in the src/app folder.

2. Configure the routes:

Import the necessary modules and configure the routes in the app-routing.module.ts. Define an array of routes, each consisting of a path and a component that should be displayed when navigating to that path.

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router'; import { HomeComponent } from './home/home.component'; import { AboutComponent } from './about/about.component'; const routes: Routes = [ { path: '', component: HomeComponent }, { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent }, // other routes... ]; @NgModule({ imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)], exports: [RouterModule] }) export class AppRoutingModule { }

In this example, we've defined two routes: the root path '' for the HomeComponent and the 'about' path for the AboutComponent.

3. Add a router outlet:

To tell Angular where to insert the routed components, add a <router-outlet> element to your app.component.html:

<!-- other elements --> <router-outlet></router-outlet> <!-- other elements -->

4. Use routerLink for navigation:

To navigate between components, use the routerLink directive in your templates. Replace the usual href attribute with [routerLink] and provide the path you want to navigate to.

<nav> <a [routerLink]="['/']">Home</a> <a [routerLink]="['/about']">About</a> </nav> <!-- other elements --> <router-outlet></router-outlet> <!-- other elements -->

In this example, the <nav> element contains two anchor tags with [routerLink] directives, allowing the user to navigate between the HomeComponent and the AboutComponent.

Now, your Angular application has routing configured and working. You can add more routes and components as needed, and you can also use route parameters, guards, and other advanced routing features for more complex applications.

Question 9: How do you manage state in an Angular application using NgRx?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
State management in Angular applications refers to the process of organizing and maintaining the data used by your application across its components. Complex applications may require a more structured way to manage state, and this is where libraries like NgRx come into play. NgRx is a state management library based on the Redux pattern, which promotes a single source of truth and an immutable state for your application. NgRx uses the concepts of actions, reducers, and selectors to manage state, making it predictable and easy to debug.

To implement state management in an Angular application using NgRx, follow these steps:

Install NgRx:
First, install the necessary NgRx packages using npm or yarn:

npm install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/store-devtools --save

2. Set up the store:

Create a folder named store in the src/app directory. Inside the store folder, create the following files: app.state.ts, app.actions.ts, app.reducer.ts, and app.selectors.ts.

Define your application state in app.state.ts:

export interface AppState { counter: number; }

In this example, we'll manage a simple counter state.

3. Create actions:

Actions represent different ways the state can change. Define actions in app.actions.ts:

import { createAction } from '@ngrx/store'; export const increment = createAction('[Counter] Increment'); export const decrement = createAction('[Counter] Decrement'); export const reset = createAction('[Counter] Reset');

Here, we've defined three actions: increment, decrement, and reset.

4. Create a reducer:

Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action, then return a new state. Define a reducer in app.reducer.ts:

import { createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store'; import { increment, decrement, reset } from './app.actions'; import { AppState } from './app.state'; export const initialState: AppState = { counter: 0 }; export const appReducer = createReducer( initialState, on(increment, state => ({ ...state, counter: state.counter + 1 })), on(decrement, state => ({ ...state, counter: state.counter - 1 })), on(reset, state => ({ ...state, counter: 0 })) );

In this example, we handle each action and return a new state accordingly.

5. Register the store:

Now, import the StoreModule in your app.module.ts and register your reducer:

import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'; import { NgModule } from '@angular/core'; import { StoreModule } from '@ngrx/store'; import { appReducer } from './store/app.reducer'; import { AppComponent } from './app.component'; @NgModule({ declarations: [ AppComponent ], imports: [ BrowserModule, StoreModule.forRoot({ app: appReducer }) ], providers: [], bootstrap: [AppComponent] }) export class AppModule { }

6. Create selectors:

Selectors are pure functions used to derive and compose data from the state. Define selectors in app.selectors.ts:

import { createSelector } from '@ngrx/store'; import { AppState } from './app.state'; export const selectAppState = (state: { app: AppState }) => state.app; export const selectCounter = createSelector( selectAppState, (state: AppState) => state.counter );

Here, we've defined a selector to get the current counter value from the state.

7. Use the store in your components:

Now you can use the store in your components to manage state. For example, in app.component.ts:

import { Component } from '@angular/core'; import { Store } from '@ngrx/store'; import { increment, decrement, reset } from './store/app.actions'; import { selectCounter } from './store/app.selectors'; @Component({ selector: 'app-root', template: ` <div> <button (click)="onIncrement()">Increment</button> <button (click)="onDecrement()">Decrement</button> <button (click)="onReset()">Reset</button> <p>Counter: {{ counter$ | async }}</p> </div> `, styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'] }) export class AppComponent { counter$ = this.store.select(selectCounter); constructor(private store: Store) {} onIncrement() { this.store.dispatch(increment()); } onDecrement() { this.store.dispatch(decrement()); } onReset() { this.store.dispatch(reset()); } }

In this example, we're using the select() method to get the counter value from the store, and the dispatch() method to send actions that modify the state. The async pipe is used to automatically subscribe and unsubscribe from the Observable returned by the select() method.

Now your Angular application is set up to manage state using NgRx. You can add more complex state objects, actions, and selectors to suit your application's needs. Don't forget to install the Redux DevTools browser extension to easily inspect and debug your application's state.

Question 10: How do you create and use observables in Angular with RxJS?

import { Observable, of } from 'rxjs'; 
import { map, catchError } from 'rxjs/operators';

const observable = of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
const transform = observable.pipe( map(value => value * 2), catchError(error => of('Error occurred')) );
transform.subscribe( value => console.log(value), error => console.error(error), () => console.log('Completed') );

//2 4 6 8 10 Completed
