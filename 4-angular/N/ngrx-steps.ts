1) Install NgRx Packages:

    npm install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/entity

2) Define Actions:

    Define the actions that represent events in your application. Actions are simple classes or objects with a type property and optionally a payload.

3) Define Reducers:

    Create reducers to handle state transitions in response to actions. Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return the new state.

4) Set up Store Module:

    Create a store module using @ngrx/store's StoreModule.forRoot() function in your Angular application's root module (AppModule). Import your reducers and pass them to the forRoot() function to configure the store.

5) Dispatch Actions:

    Dispatch actions from your Angular components or services to trigger state changes. Actions are dispatched using the Store service provided by NgRx.

6) Define Selectors:

    Define selectors to extract specific pieces of state from the store. Selectors are pure functions that take the store's state and return a specific part of it.

7) Connect Components:

    Connect your Angular components to the store using NgRx's select() function or the async pipe to subscribe to state changes.

8) (Optional) Set up Effects:

    If your application requires handling side effects such as HTTP requests, you can set up effects using @ngrx/effects. Effects listen for actions dispatched from your components, perform side effects, and then dispatch new actions based on the result.

9) Testing:

    Write tests for your actions, reducers, selectors, and effects to ensure they work as expected. NgRx provides utilities like TestStore, mockActions(), etc., to simplify testing.
