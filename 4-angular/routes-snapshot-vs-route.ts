/** Acitvated Route && Activated Route Snapshot

/** Route Snapshot Vs Router State Snapshot 
 * 
 * RouteStateSnapshot is an immutable data structure representing the state of the router at a particular moment in time. 
 * Any time a component is added or removed or parameter is updated, a new snapshot is created. 
 * 
 * RouterState is similar to RouteStateSnapshot, except that it represents the state of the router changing over time.
